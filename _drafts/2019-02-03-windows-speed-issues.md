WSL installation is having a number of issues:
1. extreme slowness
1. having to open a "placeholder" window with garbage about tty at the top before anything works
1. issues with nix install

also vs code is running extremely slow. almost unusable.

found the following article

unfortunately i had already began to nuke wsl, but i searched out the path, and there is a canonical folder in my appdata/local/packages...that i can't delete, even as administrator.
