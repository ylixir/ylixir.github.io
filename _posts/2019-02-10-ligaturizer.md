So ligatures are awesome. But Firacode is meh. I mean it's perfect, but boring. All other challengers just aren't good. The ligatures are hard to tell apart, or the glyphs have weird spacing or something.

Then I discoversed [the ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer). This is a tool that adds ligatures to normal fonts. It's awesome, and comes with a bunch of fonts out of the box. Good solid workhorser like Deja Vous, or the one I've been having a blast with...[Fantasque Sans Mono--the comic sans of programming fonts](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans).

I've been kind of sad since discovering ligatures because it's cut me off from [mononoki](https://github.com/madmalik/mononoki/). Mononoki is so good. Perfectly clean and readable, with just a hint of that old school terminal look that made me fall in love.

Sadly I left it for younger sexier ligaturized fonts. But maybe it's time to revisit it and see if some ligaturizer will make me fall in love with mononoki all over again.
