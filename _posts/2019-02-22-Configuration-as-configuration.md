<p>Configuration languages…y u so hard.</p>
<p>So the yaml at work is <em>seriously</em> out of hand. If i edit one file then I’m copypasta 14 files.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce a configuration language to ease things. The problem is that we are a PHP shop with managed servers, so popping on a native code binary is a little more annoying than it could be.</p>
<p>And there are really no options that I’m finding that are available from packagist or npm. All I really see are native options. Which would be fine if the dev team were managing the provisioning of the servers…but we are not…</p>
<p>There are a few jsonnet packages that expose the c api to java, but just want to <code>jsonnet &lt; in.jsonnet &gt; out.json</code> and call it a day.</p>
<p>Who would be interested in an an npm package wrapping a ghcjs or purescript version of dhall-lang?</p>
