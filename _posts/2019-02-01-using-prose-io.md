## Blogging with prose, jekyll and github

Apparently [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a backend. And [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) supports blogging pretty easily. All you really have to do is follow the directions on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to get set up.

Once you have a proper github page set up, then you can find a jekyll template you like from <https://jekyllthemes.org/>.

Now start blogging! One easy way to do this without dealing with the git overhead is to use <prose.io>. I'm using it now and provides a very clean interface for writing.

### prior art
- [ink] is a theme that is easy to modify
- No idea where I first heard of this. [Maybe it was here](http://allandenot.com/development/2015/01/11/blogging-like-a-dev-jekyll-github-prose-io.html)

### P.S
A while back I had this idea to made a sort of wiki/blog service using github gists. You can find the archived version of [tagist on github](https://github.com/ylixir/tagist).

Since I've learned how easy it is to get a blog up and running with github pages, I won't be working on my [tagist](https://github.com/ylixir/tagist) project anymore.
