# Dotfiles
I would like a completely portable working environment. To be able to sit down in front of a new computer and replicate my workspace in minutes.

Originally this was a random collection of shell scripts and config files, but this didn't work out.
Every system required minor tweaks and the central repo never kept up to date.
Currenlty my plan of attack is to move everything into the terminal (`tmux`, `vim`, etc) and use `nix` to manage creating a consitent and idempotent environment.
